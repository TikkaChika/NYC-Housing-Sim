# NYC-Housing-Sim
A Monte Carlo model estimating the 10-year cost of NYC’s proposed $100B housing plan. Simulates policy costs, tax savings, and budget uncertainty, then tests whether the plan fits within housing or citywide fiscal caps. This does not account for revenue generated during the 10 years.
